,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/483926-resorts-world-sentosa--hard-rock-hotel-sg-clean,KY,Diulas: 30 Mar 2020,Housekeeping & room decoration is perfect! Hotel location easily accessible to main attractions of RWS.

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/483926-resorts-world-sentosa--hard-rock-hotel-sg-clean,Verified traveler,Diulas: 23 Mar 2020,"My first time experience on a well renowned hotel was dissappointing and unexpected. Firstly, the frontline staff didnt explained clearly how incidental deposit works and what are our expectation. It should be informed clearly of how and when can we expect deposits to our account. Secondly, in a big worldly known hotel, the wifi access was limited to 3 phones only and it should be allowed for those staying since we are given a confidential password to customers in that room? I DONT GET IT! Thus, this creates an unpleasant stay for us. Regarding the breakfast, you should consider a halal certification as the location wise is for all tourists from different countries that couls savour the delicacies of halal certification. However, the F&B staffs there are very accomodating. Good Job done for them! Overall, location was excellent but not the staycation itself."

Divider between bathroom and sleeping area is translucent. Looks nice but when someone turns on the light in the bathroom, those sleeping closest get the light. Not ideal situation. Can also do with hand towel railing"

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/483926-resorts-world-sentosa--hard-rock-hotel-sg-clean,J,Diulas: 7 Mar 2020,ホテル内は至って普通。シャワーの弱さや温度調節の難しさは海外ホテルとしては許容範囲。良かった点はプールの砂が綺麗で気持ち良かった。

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/483926-resorts-world-sentosa--hard-rock-hotel-sg-clean,Chris.H,Diulas: 22 Feb 2020,"Great location, right in the centre of resorts world. Literally just a few minutes walk from key attractions like universal studios, the waterpark, Aqurium and Sentosa cable car mongst numerous other. Plenty of food options as well all within the same plaza district. Swimming pool is very large and ideal for families with small children."

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/483926-resorts-world-sentosa--hard-rock-hotel-sg-clean,Verified traveler,Diulas: 24 Jan 2020,A wonderful hotel to come back to after a long day of touring. Room was spacious for 3. Best shower EVER! Staff were so friendly especially Bryan at the poolside. The Sessions restaurant was overpriced if you don’t eat Asian food.

Basic 4* property and won’t go back Start with plus - reception staff and dining room servers, pool servers are great and pleasant Rooms are clean and in general hotel is clean Nice pool Close to all attractions Unpleasant things On arrival no one ask you about porter service Rooms are dark - more light is needed BREAKFAST - basic and very basic compared to other properties in Asia this breakfast is fast food style In general they did not put any effort to show that they want you back, it’s like you are a one time guest and who cares"
