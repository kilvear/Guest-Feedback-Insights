We also face a roof structure and when it rained, the noise was too loud. Perhaps for light sleepers, should check with front desk when they assign u the room. We spent 2 nights. Mostly spend the days at the hotel by the great pool. The pool came with an awesome slide! Woke up early one morning for a leisurely walk before breakfast.

Their pool is available 24h, you can access anytime with your room card. There is complimentary parking, remember to take your coupon at the reception before you travel out. They are so sweet, knowing that our stay is for our honeymoon, they decorated our room with helium & ""LOVE"" balloons, and sent us a delicious cake ?. I like that there is a pillow menu to choose the type of pillow you prefer, just call them and they'll bring it over. They have various lightings for different moods, I like the one that will constantly change like rainbow colours ?? The window at the bathtub allows us to watch the TV while soaking in the bathtub. There is a speaker in the bathroom, connected to the radio in the TV, you can adjust the volume and dance with the music while in the shower ??. Our Dinner & Breakfast is done at The Kitchen Table. For dinner, the Wok Fried Hor Fun with Grilled Waygu Beef has a very strong wok-hey taste, the gravy is different from usual as its thicker and loaded with black pepper. The Wok Fried Hokkien Mee could be better. The nearest convenient store closes at 8pm so we drove to the nearby 7-Eleven to grab a cup noodle & lava egg for supper, this combination is so good ?. The breakfast menu is similar to St. Regis as they are from the same group, but we prefer the menu & food at St Regis. Check out is easy, just drop your room card in the basket and they will email to you the charges. Thank you for decorating the room.",Translate Review To English

I would expect that I will be able to enjoy the afternoon tea on 9 May itself. But NOPE. It was fully booked and it wasnt indicated on the voucher that I have to make a reservation. Do the hotel really expect people to stay on 9 May and enjoy the afternoon tea on other days? What a disaster to celebrate Mother Day for my mother. I suggested to exchange the afternoon tea for dining credit but the staff has to check. (20minutes has passed while writing this review but still no update. Yes I have high expectaction) To be fair, the staff did offer to let me checkout later on 10 May to enjoy the afternoon tea but I have other schedules planned and it cannot be rescheduled. Hope this review can remind people to book their whatever tea or spa that is in the package in advance to avoid disappointment. Giving a 1 star because I am extremely unhappy and the fact that I paid extra money for the afternoon tea but did not get enjoy it. I will just treat it as ????.",Translate Review To English

Ruth,Reviewed: 5 May 2021,2.05.0Below Average,,"I checked out of W hotel this morning and I have deducted 3 stars from my review because of 3 incidents. At check in I was told that I would have to pay more because I requested twin bed. I was shocked as extra fee was not mentioned when I booked the hotel room without breakfast. I was flustered and opened klook app to look for details of my booking. I didn't want to share a king size bed with my sister. The staff quickly went into a room and promptly came out to announce that her supervisor had waived the fee. I feel that W Hotel is not honest in its advertisment - ""twin bed upon request"" means customer can asks for a twin bed instead of king size bed, extra fee should have been specified. In current time of Covid where many people are suffering from mental stress, a staycation should be a pleasant experience. In the evening, I discovered a patch of stain that could be dried blood on my duvet and I quickly rang housekeeping to change it. The next morning at breakfast, I ordered al la cart instead of buffet because I wanted a light breakfast. I picked W Hotel signature french toast and I was taken aback when I saw what's on the nice red plate. It was just One slice of thick toast sprinkled with some cream, tiny blueberries and small slices of strawberries. Perhaps I was served an al la cart buffet portion for $22 before GST. It was not air flown from Paris but made in-house. The 2 stars I gave are for the nice hotel ambience and pool experience as well as for the service by the male staff on the ground floor manning the Trace Together and temperature checks and the concierge.",Translate Review To English

Yee Ming,Reviewed: 30 Apr 2021,1.05.0Below Average,,"Extremely unpleasant experience upon check that completely destroyed our holiday mood. Booked on klook which gave the option of choosing a king sized bed or 2 beds (and we even called beforehand to ensure we would get 2 beds and they agreed). However, upon check-in the staff (an Indian man who claimed to be a manager) refused to give us 2 double beds and even insisted we pay 60 dollars extra even though there was only 2 people staying in the room. This was extremely unreasonable and unprofessional since 60 dollars was an extra person charge. Very disappointed with the poor service of a supposedly 6 star hotel.

Our Wonderful Room was clean and comfortable with the added luxury of a nice relaxing bath-tub. We included the 3 course dinner and 'All You Can Eat' awesome breakfast in our room package. The crew at The Kitchen Table was attentive and polite. We had to top up between $5 to $20 per dish from our dinner set menu. We enjoyed the quality good food but the W Burger patty was quite dry, Satay, Crispy Squid and Wagyu Hor Fun was tasty.

The surrounding area is very beautiful, with the boats at the Marina, many hip restaurants, clean water in the cove teeming with fishes and jelly fish. We even saw a big wild turtle in the cove.

Siew Ling Edlyn,Reviewed: 27 Apr 2021,5.05.0Superb,,"We had a great stay! The pool was by far the best we’ve ever experienced. So big, the water temperature was great. I liked the ala carte buffet breakfast because the selection was more exciting than a standard continental breakfast, which included local delights and “millennial food” like avo smash and granola yoghurt nut muesli mixes. I loved the gym; fully stocked with the best brand. Had a challenging workout when I set the machines to exercise programmes. If I had to pick out something I didn’t like, I’ll have to say that upkeep was not 10/10. Maybe 8-9/10. It didn’t have a sparkling clean feel, and the carpets did feel like they needed a bit of a refresher. But really no harm done because I’m just nitpicking. The other thing, which is much harder to change, is the decor of the place. Wasn’t my thing; the flowery decor and flowers in jars. It was an aesthetic I couldn’t really appreciate. The flowers at the edges of the mirrors in the bathroom creeped me out because they looked like flaking parts of the mirror or like unclean residue. Maybe it’s just me. But all in all, fantastic stay! Other than nitpicking, nothing to complain about.",

wai hoong,Reviewed: 9 Mar 2021,4.05.0Great,,"Checked into the marvelous suite just past 12nn, the process was quick and managed to reserve slots for the pool and breakfast at the same time. Room is spacious, though the view can be better if not for the condo opposite the hotel which is kind of blocking the sea view. There are also obvious wear and tear of the furniture, which I feel the Housekeeping should have noticed and rectified. Had hi-tea at Woobar, Abi from Woobar was very helpful in reserving a slot for us on the same day even though we didn't book in advance. Her service was excellent and was always wearing a smile while serving us. I have to say that service wise, W is high on my list as compared to some other local hotels I hv stayed in.",Translate Review To English

Room is spacious, comfy and clean. Booked the room with the $75 dining credit, however, this caused a big confusion during check-out as the front counter staff was unsure of process and the whole process took almost 45mins to complete. Kitchen table food is nice but on a salty and sweet side. Weirdly for the hotel standard, the female staffs all had their hair loosely untied and this is a first i see in a F&B environment. Carpark door is closed after 10pm and need to walk to car from hotel entrance to the carpark main entrance instead.
