Huge share pool that is used by the next door hotel as well - few too many kids in there for our liking although the hotel has a pool on the top floor great the restaurant that is child free- the hotel is child free so nice and relaxing. Staff were wonderful and so helpful after we found ourselves ""stranded"" in Singapore after our on- flight was cancelled due to covid19. The food was amazing!! Two wonderful nights there."
,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Marcus,Diulas: 29 Mar 2020,The hotel was the perfect place for a couple’s getaway.

The pool design was lovely and very family friendly, you can relax and read a book / tan in the shallow area (how nice to soak yourself in the hot sunny weather!) and I was surprised they had a movie screening (Moana!) on Sat evening, lovely touch. The sunset and Breeze on the rooftop bar is something not to be missed too! Overall superb stay, not to mention it’s also close to Palawan beach."

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Elizabeth,Diulas: 17 Feb 2020,The staff were so kind and thoughtful. Thoroughly enjoyed the Valentines Day flower arranging session. The Pamukale pool is fantastic - a brilliant 50 meter pool that gave me the opportunity to get my early morning swim in. My only criticism is that the VU restaurant on the 7th floor doesn’t cater for vegetarians.

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,German,Diulas: 14 Feb 2020,"he hotel is very weird. There is not really a lobby we can talk of. Rooms are small with no closet space. The monorail station is not far, but overall you take a lot of time getting into town. It is a good location for Sentosa attractions. The swimming pool is one of the nicest I have seen ever."

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Verified traveler,Diulas: 10 Feb 2020,Overall a very pleasant stay at the Outpost Hotel. Loved the decor and the lovely little touches like a personalised mini bar and complimentary coffee. The rooftop bar had a lovely view but payment is not linked to the room and the staff were not the most welcoming.
,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Verified traveler,Diulas: 6 Feb 2020,"Great location. Excellent pool. Good service. The only minor drawback is that the hotel (esp. in the pool and restaurant during breakfast hours) is too crowded. During our stay, most of other visitors were mainland Chinese (not sure if it was because we came around the Chinese NY time)."

Much needed relaxation and a great staff. Loved the adults-only pool on the roof (I was traveling alone), and the staff up there was incredible - attentive and remembered me and even my favorite drink after only a day on the roof. Highly recommended if you need a nice getaway on Sentosa for the weekend."
,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/425056-the-outpost-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Anna-Maree,Diulas: 26 Jan 2020,"I only had one night at the Outpost Hotel and I wish I could have stayed longer. While the rooms are small, they are functional and very comfortable. Their approach to sustainability is also notable with a water filter rather than plastic bottles and a mini-bar where you are encourage to take what you think you'll eat rather than leaving a fully stock mini-bar in the room which is likely to lead to waste as items reach their use by date. The free mini-bar was also a great addition to the overall experience"
