Very professional! The pools were amazing but could be very crowded at certain times of the day. It is a good idea to screen children's movies at the pools but there are not enough seats (beanbags), so we couldn't stay to watch the movies while looking after our children's slippers and towels. Native Kitchen's food was fabulous! The set meals they are currently offering now is good value for money."

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/248444-village-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Elina,Diulas: 10 Mar 2020,"The room type that we had booked was unfortunately not available as half of the rooms were apparently blocked for thorough cleaning in light of the recent pandemic situation. We thought that the initial room we booked came with a bathtub so we were quite bummed that the replacement room didn’t have one. Despite that, the complementary hotel breakfast and the gorgeous pool more than made up for the lack of a bathtub. Be sure to bring your swimming costume because the pool is extremely inviting! Location is great as it’s quiet but also accessible via monorail (just 1 stop to beach station) and the Sentosa bus to various food options around the island."

,klook.com/id/hotels/detail/248444-village-hotel-sentosa-by-far-east-hospitality-sg-clean,Takatoshi,Diulas: 29 Jan 2020,ローケーションはとても良いですね。 セントーサ内のホテルという事で、ユニバーサルにも近く歩いて行けます。部屋はコネクティングルームで、家族4人広々と寝ることが出来ました。部屋は狭いですが、寝るだけなので十分ですね！プールも広く楽しめます。 部屋の掃除が、いまいちでした。髪の毛とか、落ちたままで、掃除機をかけてるのか？という点が残念でした。
