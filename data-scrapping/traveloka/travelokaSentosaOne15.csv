But boy, was I wrong. It was one of the best and most relaxing staycation that my mum and I ever had. The rooms are pretty basic, but I loved that the bathtub was spacious and I didn't know I needed a TV while soaking in the bath! The views as what everyone said, was gorgeous. The environment definitely feel like I was in SG. We also had a good relaxing swim in the infinity-designed pool and in the ""jacuzzi"" area. To top it off, the service that came with it exceeded my expectations. A big shoutout to Royston from Latitude and Aileen from the front desk for the superb service and small little surprise that made my staycation so great. Thank you very much! Because of them, and the ""to die for"" view, I will most definitely be back. Give them a try if you're on the fence. You may just be surprised as I was.:) Psst. On a side note, if you're a light sleeper, you might be disturbed by some noises from the daily mundanes of life happening outside near the yacht area. It didn't affect me or my mum but I can see how it might affect really light sleepers, so do take note of this."

Staffs are polite and pleasant, the room is comfortable, the bathroom is huge. The bathtub is low, but I like the style, so if I don't want to soak my whole body, I can soak my feet only. The bathtub area used natural lighting so it was very bright in the morning, afternoon but very dark at night. There is a TV in front of the bathtub, but may be visible at night, in the afternoon where the sun shines brightly the screen is not visible. There is cold storage & 7 eleven nearby, so very convenient. Can walk to the other side of the pier where W hotel is, where there are many more food options."

W.,10-Nov-21,"We were greeted by 2 free roaming peacocks on arrival at the lobby entrance. It was a calming sight, and the Club has a very relax feel. The room is not luxurious like hotel but it definitely hit all the right notes, especially with 2 charging points at the bedside. (this is a 1st among my staycation). It's clean, and what you need, you get it. The twin bed is not the widest, is quite narrow, but the pillow is very comfortable. The bathroom is too spacious, you can do yoga in it. The only setback may be the way the bath room door and the standing shower door are too closed. Perhaps the latch could be on opposite site, and it will be quite perfect. Overall, nice resort feel, and stay, great pool, jacuzzi, and well equipped gym, and feel like you are overseas with the walk along the marina. Highly recommended for a getaway from the city. I intentionally do not attach any photo-you just need to be there to feel and see it yourself:)."

First of all, we've requested for a large bed, and they gave us 2 combined single bed instead. This is super uncomfortable for my partner and I as there was a hole in between the beds. Seriously never expect this from a 5 stars hotel given that the price per night is not cheap. Definitely not worth the stay per night. Secondly, we've booked a hill view room. Referring to the attached picture, our room was facing guard house and loading/unloading bay. We couldn't open up our curtain and enjoy the so called “Hill view” as the security guard or any pedestrian can easily see us in our room. 0 privacy. Through our entire stay, we were just in the room with curtains on. This make no difference than being in a room with no window. Thirdly, there was no soundproof in the room, while we were trying to sleep, we can hear people talking at downstairs even though our room was located at level 3. FYI, all the hotel room was located at level 3 except for suites. We had restless night as we couldn't sleep at night and woke up super early in the morning by the noise of lorries at the loading/unloading bay. Moreover, the hotel only has 1 lift accessible to Level 3. On 24/10/2021 night, we went for dinner outside and upon our return to the hotel, the lift broke down. Hence, we used the stairs. On the next day, the lift was still unfixed before we check out. So, we carried all of our luggage by stairs. We did call the receptionist for help in carrying the luggage but they only have a butler at that moment and we would need to wait for the assistance. As we were rushing to run our errands for the day, we couldn't wait for that long. Something to take note is that their room service is only till 9:30pm. After our dinner at outside, we reached our hotel at 10pm. We wanted to request for an ice bucket and wine glasses but these were unavailable as the room service closed at 9:30pm. This is shameful as we couldn't enjoy our wine during our staycay for the first time. Another minor point that I would like to highlight is that we've been to staycay within SG during COVID-19 period. Other hotels with a cheaper rate per night as compared to this hotel, do offer 2 free masks for the guest to change for the next day. But One 15 Marina hotel only provided us with 2 wet tissues. And we would need to reuse the same mask as the night before. I would think that this is very unthoughtful of the hotel given that this is a 5 stars hotel. And now I'm wondering if they are really worth the stars and the price per night?"

C.,21-Oct-21,"I booked a hotel room on 13/10/2021 for my anniversary. On 13/10/2021 at about 1435hrs, I arrived at the hotel lobby and told them that we are checking in. However, the room wasn't ready yet. I wish to inform that I had already pre-empt the hotel that I will be purchasing the celebration package which cost about S$58 + and I thought that it has already been prepared. While I was waiting with my wife, My wife and I saw one of the hotel staff taking the cake to my room which I was a bit disappointed as this has been planned way earlier. Luckily, the flowers were brought up to the designed room hotel which I appreciated. After that, we went up to our room, and the decoration was decent and I still managed to give my wife a surprise. The room was clean, spacious and etc. The service was fast as well when we requested water but I was shocked that when the staff told me that the two bottles of water they delivered to our room are the last two. I wish to comment that the water delivered had a weird taste to it. Especially when the hotel is a luxury five star hotel. We then requested for a late check out but we were informed that late check out is not available and we could call them again tomorrow. On 21/10/2021, we called the hotel who informed us that late check out is not available. I wish to inform that I was quite disappointed with the inflexibility of the hotel management as this is our anniversary and would expect a more flexible service from the hotel management. This is also not the first time that we had visited this hotel. Previously, it was my wife birthday and we received the same template reply for the late check out. I wish that the hotel management could improve on their inflexibility and would prepare the room beforehand whenever possible. That is all. Thank you."

Feels like we were at overseas. The staff were accomodating. We picked the marine view with the balcony overlooking the yachts. The room is spacious for 2 people and the view from the room was what made it worth. Personally, I had a short sleep but instead of waking up tired, the morning sun glistening upon the sea water made me alert and energised. However, the room lacks soundproofing and the balcony is not really private. The balcony are divided by thin walls. Which means you can hear the conversation of people next to your room and vice versa.

Upon entering the room, it was clean and cozy. However, I found the shower extremely inconvenient as we had to climb in and out of the tub to get to the shower. This is very risky for the elderly and for myself as a petite person, found it a bit cumbersome and somewhat slippery as well. Have reported this to the management and they're actively revamping the rooms to change the shower. Hence, there is ongoing drilling (which can be an annoyance at times). I was told that if you're traveling with the elderly, it's advisable to book the hill view rooms instead as they have the regular shower. All Marina rooms have this weird shower in tub situation. There is notable in the room to dine in except for the long table that the TV is one. If you intend to dine in, your best bet would be the tiny table by the balcony or on the bed. If not it can be quite an uncomfortable eating and facing the wall. Breakfast was average, it looked better than it tasted. The pastries were served cold, unfortunately. The waffles were cold as well, hence it wasn't that appetizing. The best part of the room is probably the fantastic view of the fancy yachts and homes I can never afford."

The premises are clean, staff was courteous. This is not a typical hotel and a part of a club so it is a little different. That said, the front desk was very cooperative- though I wasn't able to give them a 7 day notice for in-room decorations, they did take a print out of a birthday note etc. and place it well in the room. The bistro staff helped me place a restaurant table in the room prior to our check-in so we could order in (strictly from their currently available menu) a nice dinner. No special dinner arrangements were possible but we enjoyed our stay very much. The bathtub was a delight. It helped that there was a small outdoor playground nearby that my 6 year old daughter spent an hour at. Room was clean. Ticked all boxes for us. Good for a short staycation."

Room was dirty (think stains on floors), our tv remote was not working and had to be changed. On the second day, the toilet ceiling started leaking from a crack line, and the hairdryer button was broken as well. Adjacent rooms basically have no space between each other and soundproofing is not good, so we (just 2 of us) got complained by a neighbour about our noise levels. Admittedly, my friend and I got too excited at some points, but I could hear the conversation in the room beside when it was taking place at a normal volume. Breakfast options were limited but taste wise okay. The coffee was bad. During check in, we were not told that we had to be dressed in proper shirt and footwear to dine at the breakfast bistro, even though we were briefed on breakfast timing, location and also asked to choose our timeslot. So when we went down in our swimwear with a bathrobe over, we were denied entry (in a not very polite manner I might add) and had to go back to change. There was a sign at the bistro stating the attire requirements, but I believe this point could have been briefed to us during check in to save us (and anyone else) the hassle of having to go back to change as we would not have known this rule prior to seeing the sign? When we returned to the bistro in proper attire, we were asked to take our temperatures, but this was to be done at the clubhouse entrance (as if we were just entering the clubhouse again and not already inside), not at the bistro. Yes, the entrance was near to the bistro, but I did not understand the logistics behind this? Was it really that difficult to have another temperature screener at the bistro? When I enquired about the in-house arcade during check in, I was told that it was for kids. However, at the recreational counter, the female staff welcomed us to use the arcade (and we did). It was a mini Timezone and not an arcade targeted specifically at children, so I was confused at that discriminatory statement made by the check in staff. Facilities could be improved as well. The television in the room had no mirroring function and we could borrow a HDMI cable, but no adaptor so it cannot be connected to our phones regardless. No corkscrew/bottle opener available upon request as well. Service in general was mediocre, except for a few, like the female staff at the breakfast bistro, lady at recreational counter and temperature screening station staff. At its price point, we were definitely disappointed by our stay and the saving grace was definitely the overall resort vibes of the whole sentosa cove village area."

H.,10-Apr-21,"Stayed a night at One 15 - Sunday to Monday. What we liked: Paid a little extra for the quay view. Lovely & peaceful to have a balcony view of the quay. Room was not big, but sufficient with bathtub (TV by the tub) and we could adjust curtains via touchscreen by the bed. There’s a pool, gym and arcade room (which we didn’t have time for) We would like to thank Jane and Aileen for their excellent hospitality. It seems like a small team of staff. Jane and Aileen were helpful and friendly. A pack of yummy chocolate was hand delivered to us as a birthday gift. That was a nice personal touch (vs simply leaving in the room). We also appreciated that the bathrobes came in a “ladies” size. What we didn’t like: We didn’t add on for hotel breakfasts as we wanted to eat at the restaurants along the quayside. There’s a wide variety of cuisine. Too bad that most of them open from 11am/ lunch and dinner only. Ended up grabbing snacks from the 24hour 7eleven a short walk away. *i recommend adding on hotel breakfast* *5 min walk to bus stop where the sentosa bus shuttles the beaches and attractions. Once every 15mins* Next day (Monday) at Sentosa was a big meh as most of the attractions were not open/could not redeem for tokens we bought Overall very pleasant stay! Thank you to the team at One 15."

T.,9-Feb-21,"My husband & I booked our honeymoon here in last Oct, though the customer service shown wasn’t exemplary but we liked the balcony view & the bathtub enough to return for another stay in early February. We also booked another 2 rooms for our parents as well. Unfortunately, upon checkout, we were informed that as the hotel staff found evidence of smoking in my parents’ room they had to fine us $200. The hotel staff insisted that this was mentioned to my elderly parents upon check-in but they did not seem to be aware of it as they are not fluent in English and they were not informed of the fines involved. After checking out of one15, we moved to another hotel also at Sentosa and we could tell the customer service provided by them was very much in contrast to the one given to us by one15. It was so much better that we extended another night at the other hotel. The experience at one15 left a very bad taste in one’s mouth that we don’t think we’ll ever go back again."
