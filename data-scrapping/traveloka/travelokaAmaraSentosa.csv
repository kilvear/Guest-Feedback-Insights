Then the receptionist started processing and passed me the welcome drink and carpark coupon, saying I can have a drink while waiting for a room to be ready but not guiding me how to get to the shutters restaurant. I wasn't fully packed, so I was dragging a luggage and a pair of shoes, and no offer was made to keep my luggage at the concierge. After my drink he brought my keycard and I went to the room, only to find out the phone wasn't working at all. The housekeeping lady outside was nice to help me alert the front desk and the same receptionist came up to only ask me to call this number for any requests using my own phone, and explained that the system is down due to a lightning strike-a week ago. TV had several channels missing as well. Upon check out at 10am, there was nobody at the front desk for a few minutes. I looked around and a lady was ferrying a family, probably from the villas. She saw me and quickly parked and tended to me. Whilst I do not think it is the fault of the staff completely, I think the management of the hotel on Sentosa island can be better. Please do better to represent us to our visitors. Thank you."

We ended up""lost""and eventually found out that we could actually hitch the Sentosa buses around the island instead of walking so much unnecessarily. Housekeeping staff also entered our room to clean up and replenish even though we didn't request for it. Their staff need to be more sufficiently trained to increase their efficiencies for better customer service in meeting customers ' needs. Their buggy service is only limited to traveling around the resort. Maybe the resort can offer buggy services to nearest Imbiah station. Their cable TV has limited channels and a few channels do not even have audio. For the price paid, one would expect better services and amenities."

M.,4-Dec-21,Pros: 1. Quiet nice ambience location. 2. Room is reasonably clean. 3. Good location in Sentosa (near Siloso and RWS) accessible with shuttle buses. Cons. 1. Receptionist and housekeeping seems understaffed. Long waits for calls. (Housekeeping came to explain aircon usage only after 30mins from call) 2. Road to carpark is unlit and dark during nights. 3. Double Bed mattress is hard and quilt is thin. And double bed is actually 2 beds put together instead of X1 king size bed! ☹☹ 4. Shower taps unable to fully be turned off after usage dripped for a good 10mins after. Irritating. 5. Aircon system is not user friendly. Need to tweak temperature up and down and wait for temperature indicator to catch up. Wasn't inform of this method until housekeeping came to explain. 6. Check in later than expected. We arrived one hour after check in timing 3pm and was surprised to be informed that room only available another hour later! We only checked in at 5pm. And no goodwill offers for our time loss. Disappointing. Overall unsatisfied stay at this price and I reckon better deals are available at other hotels. Hope the above feedbacks lead to improvements for Amara Sanctuary.

Appreciate the reception who gave us good rooms though. Reception is friendly, just too much waiting time and not really a decent waiting room. It ' s a very dusty meeting room which I don't even dare sit on the sofa. We have a decent room, beds and all are clean and comfortable. The next day we had breakfast at shutters. We went at early morning 8am, we are the only group there but food and coffee took very long to serve. The waiter is nice, but you can hear the chef being rude to the waiter, not a pleasant experience. I don't think I will come again cause most time is actually spend waiting for a room/food for our short 2D1N staycation."

While we were provided welcome drink vouchers and asked to wait in the restaurant, there was no estimation as to how long we had to wait. At approximately 4.15pm, I checked with the staff on the estimated wait time and was told the room would be ready latest by 5pm. However there were no further updates then and upon further enquiry the room was still not ready and we had to wait for an additional 15 minutes after I expressed my displeasure. It was a very bad experience and dampened our spirits for the weekend with the wait and lack of updates. While the staff extended our check out time, it was not very helpful since we had plans the next day. In addition this would likely result in a snowball and the same waiting time would apply to the next guests."

The photos online do not do any justice. The hotel is looking tired and old and not as beautiful as in reality! Yes, I booked this through the app and used my RSV and unfortunately, there was no package that is with breakfast or meal included and villas were sold out and so I booked Deluxe (with balcony). I did highlight or indicated that this is a gift for their wedding so please offer special perks. No reply. I wrote to one of the Duty Managers regarding the same, no reply. The breakfast was ordinary and no quality. Their room 320 is without a balcony! The entire experience is unpleasant. The Management makes no effort to create a special moment for the wedding couple, this is sad for a ' so-called ' 5 Star Resort! It was just an overnight stay, nothing to wow about! Sorry to say."

We had a plank right outside our pool facing door that was completely detached from the ground and would flip up when stepped on, so we had to be careful to go around it. Front desk unavailable, no one picks up the phone. Hot water tends to run out sometimes too.

Small piece of tile is jutting out. Small bummer # 2. I cut a deep gash on my feet at the sky pool when a piece of rock tile got dislodged when I was coming up from the pool.

Later on, we were asked to take screenshots to be emailed to the Front Desk which was a shock too as I was under the impression that it was PDPA? However, the staff just replied back “its the hotel policy.” We just followed instructions since we didn’t want to linger around the reception too long as well. Overall, the rooms are dated, but had the resort vibes so I feel its acceptable and spacious and quiet. Swimming pool facilities required booking and the booking system was relatively easy to use too to request for items and book slots. We were here for 3D2N and when we were out to play on our 2nd day, we returned to find out that one of the rooms were not being make-up. However, the Housekeeping attendant was really apologetic and we asked if he could just help us to clear the trash instead since it was late already. Mark (hskp supervisor) gave a call later to extend apologies too which we gladly accepted. I really wanted to extend my compliments to Pavitha (Reception), she was really professional and courteous at all times and made me felt really comfortable at the reception compared to my 1st encounter. She definitely did help made the stay a lot more enjoyable, but of course, its always the 1st impression that matters they say."

However the first room given to us was not nice at all. The sofa had hair and not clear, the room aircon was not working, the temperature was 27 and we were sweating inside the room. We called for repair guy, he spend 15 min trying to fix aircon. After that he said try it for 45 min and if its not fixed, we will change the room for us. And he said he will inform the front desk. After 45 min the temperature only improved to 26.5 degree. We call front desk to change room. We had to pack again go down. We got another room, after staff checked the aircon. The staff said monitor the aircon for an hour. We went for a swim, after an hour I check the temperature was at 26, so I called front desk again and ask for repair guy again, while we went for a swim. After that went to front desk to ask if aircon is fixed. She show me a picture showing 19 degree temp using hand held device pointing at the aircon. While the room temperature showing 25.4 degree in her pictures. To me this seems like a case of under power aircon for room size. But hotel staff said that the aircon is fine. All their room aircon are like that. So we have no choice but to live with it. We came to the room, the room temperature shown was 25.4 and it stayed at the temperature until late. This is little hot for us and I was sweating a little. Later at night, when outside temperature dropped the aircon temperature got to 24. X around mid night. After which the room was OK to sleep. This is the last place I would recommendation to anyone during the lockdown, cause you need to eat in your room to eat as restaurants are closed. Unless you don't need aircon and don't mind old dirty furniture. In the late morning, I had to take off my shirt again. That did help to avoid sweating for me. The room view was nice. Wish they had proper air-condition and bit more cleanliness especially during covid period. Guest can feel relax and actually enjoy the location. Sentosa is still a fantastic choice for Singaporeans. But other hotels are much better to stay. This is certainly not recommended by me. Picture of the chair attached from room 416. Its self explanatory and reflect the condition on this hotel"

The only pet-friendly room is the courtyard room which the the hotel had suggested to downgrade the booking with no refund on the difference. As there was no resolution, we requested to see the manager. The hotel manager, Poom, was by far very helpful and assisted to resolve the sticky situation instead of turning us down.
