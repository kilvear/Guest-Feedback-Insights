The shower area and the shower curtains had mildew, and toilet bowl seat had stains. The aircon could only be set at 25 degrees celcius and it's hot to sleep at night, would advise you to call the front desk for help on that. We didn't do so as our children were already asleep."

Upon booking the stay on the website, I called up RWS to reserve a cot but it seems like this request was not told/indicated in their system as the hotel recep wasn't aware of it. 2) I also told the call operator that this stay was meant to celebrate my son's first birthday and if we could request some deco. The operator told us it's possible but deco will be simple (basically deco the room with some balloons). Well, nothing happened during our stay … …. 3) Non-smoking room/king bed. All these were requested during the booking on the website. I even went to RWS website to book a check-in time slot between 12 to 12.59pm. During the check-in, recep told us only left with smoking rooms and if we wanted non-smoking room, we had to wait till 3pm. We agreed and confirmed on a non-smoking room with king bed. Guess what? We came at 4pm (gave them more time to prepare) and was given non-smoking but double-bed room. To be fair, these were resolved eventually but I believe all these could have been avoided if the staff were more attentive towards customers’ requests/needs."

When we ask, they said they stop anniversary decoration since Covid (which is not true because I saw another review in Oct 2021 that they did have some simple deco for their room). The booking of check-in time is completely useless. Because you still need to queue or take a queue no. I have registered my room at 9:30 am and we went off to adventure cove, when we came back at 5 pm, we still have to queue for 30 mins to get our key! The machine for getting queue no for collecting key is not working! In the evening, we wanted to ask for a bottle opener, called for 20 mins, no one answer the call.

Upon reaching the hotel at 3.30pm (our check in slot booked online was 4pm-4.59pm), we were issued a queue number for check-in and was told the wait is approximately 1.5hrs, which I feel it's quite reasonable (as it's school holidays). At 5.10pm we went back to the hotel to our dismay it's not even close to our number. Fine… we went for dinner, after our dinner close to 7pm our queue number has yet to appear on screen, as patience is running out we went to join a queue at the hotel recep to find out the situation and finally got our keys. Upon check in we requested for late check out and the staff offered us to check out at 12pm, which is unreasonable for the price we are paying and the whole afternoon we've wasted? However we requested to check out at 3pm and they agreed on it. But the next day, we couldn't gain access to our room slightly aft 2pm so we went to the receptionist to verify the situation they couldn't find the records after we have spend our night in the room, shortly after I was told that our room has been check out. 🤦🏼‍♀️ (Our luggage is still inside the room.) However the lady assisted on this issue was very nice and smiley we manage to resolve the issue within 10mins (including the wait for my turn). To sum up everything, if you intend to stay at this hotel, please brace yourself to pay for a stay full of hiccups and a long waiting game. Good luck. On the bright side, room is clean and spacious even with a baby cot, room service is efficient and staff is smiley. Location is perfect. P. S. Given the price you're paying I'm sure you get a different hotel with better service and shorter waiting time."

Firstly, there is no number to call for inquiries before arrival. The room was large but there were no room service, no bathrobes, no mini bar, only one restaurant and a balcony that does not open. The toiletries was an all-in-one hand/body/shampoo and no conditioner. This I expect from a by-the-hour hotel and not something I pay hundreds for. The no room service and mini-bar was because of""COVID""but I stayed at the Fullerton, they provided these services. Worse of all, most of the restaurants in Festive Walk was closed that Friday I was there, we have to go to Vivo for food. Our TV language was set to mandarin and remote does not work. Reported to front desk who assured they would send a technician but when we returned from dinner, TV was not fixed and not note/update. I tried to support but I felt really shortchanged staying in RWS. I might as well stayed home."

And the security is tight-we need to show photo ID to access the lifts and must use the key card to access the floor. The room that was cleaned had a sticker seal on the door. The room is big. Basic toiletries are given-shampoos, body wash, toothbrushes, vanity set (cotton bugs & pads), shower cap. 2 kinds of TWG teabags (Sencha & English breakfast tea-2 each) & instant Nescafe coffee are also given. Towels are ample-but I have 1 gripe. There's a large brown stain on one the towels."

Only downside is we have to dial 0 using the phone in the room to call for room service (which we were not aware of) so we had to check with the receptionist.

It was a weekday, I booked from Tuesday to Thursday, how can there be not enough rooms even at 3 pm? Anyway, aside from that, the location isn't the best. It ' s like a ghost town unless you're going to USS or sea aquarium. If not there is really nothing much to do. I mean the beach was beautiful and pretty chill. I think that ' s good. But I gotta say the security there is great, they would ensure you're the visitors that registered with them upon check-in every time you want to head to your room. Kudos to working 24/7!

I rejected it straight away and later they can give me a room of my choice. Secondly, the bed is non-standard as it sink easily when I slept on it. I did not sleep well for my 2-nights stay and I will not be coming back or recommend this hotel to anyone else. I don’t know why. When I was on oversea trips, if they can’t meet my pre-booking room, they will offer me a higher type and better room instead. The attitudes of the staffs are completely different also."

In the end, I parked at the West side, and didn't know the hotel is at the East side. It was a long walk from the carpark at the West side (Convention Centre), through the now-defunct Festive Hotel, across the luxury shops to Hotel Michael. When my wife and I got there and tried to check in, we were told that there was only a twin room with our special requests (high floor and non-smoking). The King bed room was located at a low-to-mid level, and the view was disappointing. The window is looking out at the tram track with the back view of USS. We were even shocked at the facilities provided by a 5-star hotel, (1) gym is not fully-equipped, and only provide huge towels, (2) swimming pool is odd shape, and very small. The breakfast served at the hotel was a decent set meal (choose either Western, Chinese or Italian), and you can add on more servings of your selected cuisine if you like. The only consolation is a quiet walk down the Resorts World area, as well as some of the restaurants (if they are open during this pandemic). The hotel could have done better in terms of offering amenities and activities to do during the stay."

C.,11-May-21,"I was initially worried with the waiting time to check in after reading the reviews and reached an hour earlier to get a queue number. Imagine my shock when I saw there were at least 30 other people in front of me checking in on a Monday afternoon. I was mulling over what to do and I found out there were two self check-in stations at the waiting area, which was strangely under-utilised. There was a staff member helping out at the stations but the self check-in was pretty much a breeze when you have your identification with you. I am not sure why no one was using them. I got my card keys from the system and was able to check in within 15 mins. The room was bigger than the pictures. I was pleasantly surprised. Room was very clean and well-kept except I think the shower curtain should be changed as it looked a little mouldy. My room package comes with dinner and breakfast at Fratelli and the food was delicious. The four course dinner for two was absolutely worth it. It did not come with drinks but the prices of the drinks were reasonable. Service at the Fratelli was also good. They were attentive and quick at clearing tables and serving food."

However, prior to entering the lift lobby, there was an identity check counter to ensure we were registered guest which I can totally understand the intend. However the various staffs carrier out this duty throughout our 2D1N stay were unfriendly, we felt like we in a military camp whereby we need to report all of our ID numbers to them and waiting for them to grant permission for us to get to our rooms (by waving their hands to signal us to enter). I am sure it could be done in a better way to make us feels more welcomed? Whilst social distancing needs to be observed, we were not informed in any occasion that there is a need to make reservation to use the pool. We had to take up the only time slot available on our check in day 7pm-8pm in order to use the pool (with 2 children).

W.,1-Mar-21,"When I arrived at the Hotel Michael after 3 pm, I handed over my car to the courteous valet service. Then I was surprised by the crowd waiting to check-in. Each queue number took 5 min to clear. We waited till 6 pm to complete the entire id scanning and registration. During registration of my 2nd room, I was puzzled when the message from the registration machine at the waiting area said no room available. I was led to the counter to settle the issue. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised that one of my rooms was upgraded to a suite. The suite turned out to be very spacious, clean and with a great view on the 7th floor. It has a TV in front of the king size bed and another at the living room. The toilet was hugh and comes with a bath tub and showering area. Only downside is that it is a smoking floor and so the smell was not pleasant. However we opened up both windows to let fresh air in through the 2 balconies and after a while the air cleared up. The other room was a standard double bed room on the 8th floor just above the swimming pool. It was clean and nothing to complain about. For dinner, we opted to have it late at 9 pm. So instead of walking further to dine around Hard Rock Cafe, we decided to settle at the hotel restaurant. My wife and I ordered a large pizza and a vongole appetizer while my children selected beef pastas. The pizza was tasty and I feel nothing special to describe. The vongole came with some white bread to dip into the sauce and the taste was heavenly. We loved it so much that we asked for more bread to dip into the sauce. The pasta was equally unforgettable especially the rich aroma that came out of the beef when you chewed on it. I don't have the vocabulary of a food reviewer but I recommend to anyone to have a try yourself. Not forgetting to mention the courteous attitude and the pleasantness we felt from the restaurant staff both during the dinner and breakfast. Each of our breakfast was served in a blink by different staff. I have to specially mention a waitress named Vivian who talked to us at dinner and breakfast - bubbly, cheerful, efficient with a sense of humour. Overall, this is a fantastic staycation for my family celebrating my wife's birthday. After all, what more could one ask for in the midst of pandemic when we are given a chance to take a vacation in a place that feels like oversea and subsidised with $100 Singapore Rediscovery voucher for each room."
