Check-in was relatively simple, even at the self-check in machine, with the help of the staff, and the rooms are spacious and bright. Had indicated previously our preference for a high level, forest-facing room which the hotel easily accommodated, and we had a fantastic view of the cable cars amidst the rainforest. And the toilet is an experience in itself, with a great big bathtub and rain shower. Swimming pool had to be booked but was lovely and unique with resort feels as well. There's also a free shuttle bus which which brings you to the main RWS area and back, and is available till nighttime. Check out was even faster and just required returning the key cards. Do remember to approach the counter staff to get the complimentary parking coupon though.

Self-service check-in is not at all user-friendly, even their staff started arguing among themselves while trying to assist.  2. Booking of check-in time and pool prior to checking in to the hotel could be easily missed/ overlooked. By the time when I heard from a friend who has recently stayed at the same hotel, that I need to pre-book the use of the pool before checking-in, the only available timeslot was at 11am the following day and check out time was 11am. Most hotels are granting late check out at 3 pm onward for staycation.  3. We were so looking forward to the hotel breakfast and we got the worst shock of our life when we saw the breakfast menu. If the hotel cannot serve a buffet breakfast, they should at least serve a decent a la carte buffet breakfast. The Chinese set breakfast was a disgrace. Bland white porridge with a few pcs of cuttlefish, 2 pcs of shrimps, and crabsticks for hotel standard seafood porridge. We had staycation experience in other hotels and so far, this is our worst experience. Glad that we only stayed one night. For more than $600 per room per night for this kind of experience really sucks!"

Upon arrival at the hotel, however, we were informed that the rooms were not ready and we had to inform the staff again on our bed arrangement. We also requested for rooms on high floor but in the end, I believe we were given rooms on low floor as those were the only ones that were available after at least a 30 minutes at the check in process. 2) Our request for special arrangement for my dad's birthday was not delivered to the front desk as well. In the end, we only got a card and a few Ferraro Rochers (which seems like a last minute work) when we were expecting more from a 5-star hotel. 3) We also made prior pool reservation but when we checked with the staff working at the pool, our reservation was not recorded. 4) Towels and water were not provided for the third person staying in the room after housekeeping on the second day. All these made our stay at the hotel unpleasant. We were hoping for more from a 5-star hotel."

People seen sitting on the sofas some were lining up at the front desk. The machine to check in wasn't able to detect booking either So the staff had to eventually help me out manually. But can I say that the staff were extremely patient and so kind despite the busy peak hours. Very polite and whenever we called for assistance from the room, the service came within 5 minutes. The room was so big as well! Amazing view facing Harbourfront! Breakfast isn't buffet style but there ' s a menu for you to choose the mains. Keep in mind that the restaurant is not in Equarius OK! You gotta take the cute buggy at the entrance and they'll bring you to the other hotel. Love the ride, I think its super worth it. Highly highly recommend!

Came in 2.30pm, checked in to hotel room only at close to 4.30pm."

Waited almost an hour to check in. Waited another 30min to get the key to 1 of our connecting rooms at 3.30pm. Waited for another 1.5hr and after 3 phone calls to collect the key for the other connecting room at 5pm! Tried booking swimming pool timing for 2nd day but the link doesn't help at all. Emailed in and finally managed to get a booking. Check out time indicated on booking is 12pm. However at check in, we were told check out time is at 11am. And they extended till 12pm upon request. On last day when I called the guest services to ask about how to check out. I was told again that my check out time is at 11am. I understand the hotel is shorthanded and needs longer time to do a good disinfection job. However, a 1.5 hour gap between getting the 2 connecting rooms ready doesn't make sense. The Good: Hotel rooms are huge. Bathrooms are huge. Beds are huge. Hotel staff arranged for some simple deco and gifted us some ice cream to celebrate my girl's birthday. Hotel staff are helpful. Swimming pool is simple but pleasant because of the crowd control. Overall a good stay if not for the long wait at check in. It's also inconvenient to travel to other parts of the island unless you drive. Otherwise you will have to take the free shuttle service, walk 5min to sentosa express."

The view was spectacular, I could see the cable cars from the balcony and hear birds chirping away in the morning. Taking the shuttle bus to the Casino area was hassle-free. The swimming pool is a short walk away at the beach villa. Booking in advance is required for swimming session, since they limit the no. Of pax at the pool, it was not crowded at all.

It seems we have asked for adjoining rooms during our booking and it May not have gotten registered though their was an acknowledgment given. Housekeeping was still cleaning up the rooms. We were than put in a holding room while waiting for the rooms after another 20 mins check between reception and housekeeping. Nonetheless we appreciated the efforts.

Hotel was clearly understaffed, we had to queue and wait quite a while before the only two staff in the whole reception area could attend to us, probably because the self-check-in machine could not detect lots of bookings. Understand that it’s covid season so checking in and out is crucial, however when we had to go swimming, we did not bring anything with us and we’re stranded with staff insisting that we need the physical ID or soft copy on our phones. We had checked in earlier and staff at the entrance had laptops with all our names and details, unsure why they couldn’t check their and than. Unpleasant experience for that.

Really love the spacious and clean deluxe room, and their bathroom is amazingly huge and pretty with a bathtub! The only downside is that the pre-packed breakfast served every morning due to the ""no dining in"" rule was really disappointing. The quality of the food was really bad, with the bacon always being overly salty, and the scrambled eggs being overcooked and mushy, the baked pastries tasted stale as well. Hope that the hotel will be able to do something about the breakfast since the prices include free hotel breakfast (which was supposed to be of quality standard before the ""no dine in"" rule. Otherwise, can opt for no breakfast during this period of time and just go for the rooms!"

However, there are no bath salts provided, you will have to get your own. The amenities provided are 2-in-1 hand & body wash and 2-in-1 conditioning shampoo. The balcony has a great view of the cable car, beautiful especially in the evening. I spent a lot of time sitting outside to relax with some drinks. There is no room services options at all, you have to get your own food, or order via food delivery. The nearest food options are at Hotel Michael, which is a 5 minutes shuttle bus away. I gave this hotel overall unsatisfactory as the check in was not smooth and coordinated from the start. Upon booking, my requests for early check-in at 12pm was acknowledged by the hotel. I understand that it is still subject to availability but on the day itself, even when I arrived at 2:30pm, I can only check in at 3:30pm. I was given a queue number to wait for check-in. After 15-20 minutes, I was attended by Eugene which brought me to a self check-in station. I faced some issues with registration as they could not find my Booking ID, but when I eventually finished registration, I was told to wait to receive a SMS when my room is ready. The weather was really hot, I was thirsty and I just wanted to check in already. After 30-40 minutes, my room key is finally ready for collection. I asked for directions on where to collect, and was told to go to the concierge. When I went to the concierge, the staff told me to go the check-in area. (?) I had to walk around with my heavy bag for another 10 minutes because the staffs were directing me everywhere. When I finally check in, my partner which was sharing the room with me, said that I had to go down and pick him. Yet earlier, the hotel staff Eugene had informed that once I registered a room guest, I do not have to go down and pick them. They can self-check in upon arrival and be given a room key. After finally being able to check-in, I went down to pick up my partner. All these poor communication led to a very unsatisfactory check-in experience. I understand that we have to be extra vigilant during this covid period, however I did not face such frustration at other 5 stars hotels. I hope they can improve on their staff communication and check-in procedure. Besides that, I would still recommend this hotel as a great getaway due to its location."

From the moment we checked in, service was impeccable. It was little #JEO ‘s 4th birthday celebration and he had requested for a “hotel stay” (kids these days!) and so when Ms Jesslyn at the front desk knew about this, she gifted us with gifts for the little ones. #JEO was over the moon to have not 1 but 4 ice cream cups to start off his holiday! The staff were so attentive and we must applaud Ariel who was always greeting us with a smile - in spite of the mask, we knew he was always smiling from the spring in his step and the chirpiness of his voice. We met so many lovely guests too at the hotel - one of the families even gifted #JEO with his first cable car figurine as a birthday gift! We were really amazed at the sheer size of the room - 51 sq m was a great amount of space for 2 young kiddos to play and roam around! The size of the bathroom was perfect too! The only gripe we may have would be a suggestion for the hotel to include / provide bath amenities for young children / infants? You guys had a baby bath tub and a cot but didn’t have any bathing amenities for kids! This was a first I’ve encountered for a local staycation - even business hotels we’ve stayed in had amenities for children. Nonetheless, it was otherwise a very very lovely stay for us, glad we had a good time before CB- lite commences. Thank you Ms Jesslyn and your team for being ever attentive to us. Even the operator was always so delightful to talk to. From front desk to housekeeping, we had so many different encounters with the lovely hospitality team. So kudos to the management for incorporating a culture that percolates genuine happiness from the bottom up so we would enjoy our stay as guests."

The fridge has a weird smell and we did not use at all. Buggy frequency ok but the staff over at hotel Michael side needs to ensure proper queuing of guests using the rides. Went during weekdays and most of the shops and restaurants were closed.

S.,7-May-21,"Wasn’t able to check in early, went in at usual check in time 3PM but was told the room was not ready yet. The check in area was very crowded, looks like early check in wasn’t possible. After one hour of waiting, we went back to ask and was told the room is still not ready. But by then most of the guests were cleared. Pretty unfair that we were held back for so long, we asked when would it be ready and the staff couldn’t answer us, said latest by 5PM. Usually check out time for most hotels is 12pm but this hotel was 11am. 4 hours to prepare rooms were not enough on a weekday? End up need 6 hours? On previous staycations there were times we were denied late checkout in order to prepare for the next guest’s room, where was this preparation? They told us 1PM was the latest checkout they could give, which was essentially giving us back the 2 hours they took from us. We couldn’t put our bags down and go explore sentosa in 2hours. Even if we could, they couldn’t tell us only after 1.5h when our room will be ready. Giving us back the time they took from us was not enough, it should have been a given since it was their error. When we asked if there was more that could be done for us like dining credits or upgrade or later checkout, they said no. That is really bad service when it’s my friend and mine’s special day to celebrate my graduation but instead my day of planned activities were thoroughly ruined. Giving us 2 hours more of hotel wouldn’t have remedied our compromised plans. After we checked into our room we called the guest service to ask again if something could be done and they said they would call us back. They in fact never called back. Furthermore, we asked for a knife to cut some fruit but were told there were no sharp items as part of their policy. Seriously? There was also no conditioner and laundry bags which I thought was a given. I used to bring those until 5 hotels I’ve been to provided them. This is a small matter but still we were somewhat inconvenienced. The room was great, but what horrified us was that there were dead flies found on the bathtub overnight. The tub was big and spacious which we enjoyed but finding flies on it the next day was gross. They also didn’t bother to cover the mattress. When we asked for more tea, they gave them to us in a trash bag. Overall very disappointing service, which we expected more since it’s a sentosa staycation. Undeniably the room was big and nice except for the lack of some stuff provided and the dead flies. Poor service and lack of preparation really ruined our staycation experience. We expected more since it’s sentosa and meant to be more ‘atas’. Also instructions to get here were not accurate, we spent an hour walking around trying to find the place until we were told you can’t even walk there and need to take another shuttle service that is not advertised or shown publicly. The directions given on the website are not good enough. What was very apparent was that the staff didn’t care about us. We are relieved our 2 hours were given back to us, but the coldness towards us when we asked for more were not appreciated (they initially wanted to give us 1 hour back only). We felt like we didn’t ask for much, we just wanted a gesture or token for the severe inconvenience and unhappiness they caused us. It’s a staycation meant for us to relax but we were kept stalled and idling when we had a whole day planned for us (I.e. go to the beach then have dinner - instead just have dinner cause no time to go to the beach else too late to have dinner, and then it rained the next day so can’t go to the beach) Felt like it was a waste of the SRV voucher, without the app deal to cover some of the costs, we would be way more infuriated. Still, $131 was a waste of money, I can definitely get better service and experiences from other 5 star hotels with the same money with SRV and app deals. Though the room is spacious and nice, our experience is screaming otherwise especially with the flies. Both my friend’s skin and mine broke out the next day, making us question the cleanliness of the place or the sheets since our room took that long to get ready. The shortage of staff probably was so that the rooms were not even thoroughly cleaned. Not sure if this is typical of Sentosa hotels but most likely not coming back here again. Seriously, I expect this kind of experience or service from a 2 star hotel, or even 3 star hotel staff service. The staff were not even apologetic. The safe distancing ambassadors and shuttle staff were even friendlier than the hotel staff"

Y.,7-May-21,"Had a hard time looking for directions to Equarius as no information was provided, even their signboards at RWS was not updated with 'Equarius'. Thankfully we managed to find St Michael's Hotel and took a buggy from there. Arrived at the hotel after a long wait for the buggy (buggy timing intervals can be improved). Sadly, there was no staff to greet nor direct us to the check in counter (disappointing for a 5 star hotel), we had to look around for staff only to see SDAs, which was very confusing as they seemed to be managing the check in queue instead of uniformed staff. Got a number from an SDA (not a hotel uniformed staff, confusing) and the queue was horrendously long. Thankfully I walked around the hotel while waiting and then noticed there was a self check in counter which had a short queue and managed to check in smoothly without having to wait in the queue. Would have appreciated if the SDAs since there was barely any other staff around, had the initiative to direct us to the self check in machine instead of just directing us to join the queue; this will not only improve your guests waiting time but also your hotel productivity (that's the point of your machine right?). Room was huge, clean and was overall great. But not so satisfied when the TV was not in working condition, the toilet bowl area had a strong sewage smell and one of the power point was not working. Disappointing in these aspects. Also pretty disappointed that it was our anniversary (had notify the hotel), but all we got was a card that was not signed off by any staff and a sad looking single red balloon, not impressive at all. Had higher expectations as I saw multiple reviews that other guests when celebrated their anniversary at Equarius received teddy bears, signed cards by staffs, complimentary room upgrade etc...All we got was a card and balloon. Other 5 stars hotel would at least fold towels into swan shapes and place it on the bed or put some petals around the room.. Not impressed for our special occasion. :( Would give this experience a 2.5/5, may not be back again as the experience didn't WOW me at all and the hotel isn't exactly located conveniently anyway. :("

But staff was not efficient due to miscommunication or overworked I suppose. Waited for about 2 hours to check in; staff said one of our rooms had no bathtub which was incorrect. There are bathtubs for our 2 rooms. Requested for adjoining rooms, got them but one door linking our rooms was faulty and could not be opened at all. We did not bother to report anyway. My children were locked out of their rooms after their swim on the 2nd day as they thought they had checked out which was ridiculous. They apologised and gave us an extra hour to check out though. On the whole, just felt that the service fell short of our expectations given that the hotel is reputed to be one of the best in RWS."

Furnishings are plush, well maintained, and as each room has a balcony (mine overlooks the adventure cove waterpark), it truly feels like you are “overseas” for a while as compared to a staycation in town. Breakfast (need to take a shuttle to Hotel Michael) is decent if you need to fill your stomach but ok to skip too if you like to sleep in. Check in was a little slow and the need to check nice everytime you wish to go back to the room from the lobby is quite a hassle. The shuttle service from Monday 3.30pm onwards till Fri apparently is only provided via buggy rides (so you can still get a little wet when it rains).

Y. L.,14-Apr-21,"Pros: Spacious room Nice pool Cons - base on expectation of a 5 stars hotel: 1) Check in is such a hassle; reach around 2pm and was told to wait in a waiting area with a waiting number and when your number is called, you need to wait again near the check in counter, once its your turn for check in, they register you and tell me my room is not ready and I need to check later with the concierge at 3pm to see if my room is ready. Check with concierge at 3.05pm and was told its not ready and told me to wait for another 15mins. When I go back 15mins later, I was again told it is not ready and say to wait 5mins, when I go back 5mins later I was told to queue up for my turn, 20mins in the queue did I finally get my room. 2) Weird smell on the bed sheets. Not sure what detergent the hotel use but the smell is not pleasant. 3) There is a drainage smell in the bathroom. the bathroom is very big with a bathtub and a separate shower area, the stench come from there which after some investigation, I conclude the shower area might not have been use for awhile (who will use that if there is a bathtub available), I suspect the smell come up from the shower area drainage hole. 4) Tattered hand towel, I am surprised a 5stars hotel never screen through the towel they serve. 5) Dusty at some area in the room. Some area of the rooms are not clean up properly, the study table below the table is dusty. 5) Staff nor evenly distributed to work around. There are 4-5 staff around check in area and the secondary waiting area but only 3-4 check in counters are open. There are another 2 staff to check your ID at a narrow walkway towards hotel lift, do they need 2 person there since there is only 1 laptop doing the checking? How many checking do we need, Too many checks for my leisure stay not a relaxing staycation. Overall not worth the price, I pay almost $600 for 3d2n. I have been to other hotels during this period and the check in is a breeze and I was even given early check in from hotels busier than Equarius and I also saw quite a few hotel guest complaining the same thing."

However, the check in process is too long. Reached around 2.30pm and check in waiting time took almost an hr and after that room wasn't ready till 5pm. That was quite a letdown and time wasted. The location is a distance from the main Resort World area but there is free shuttle to bring us over. Only thing is the waiting time sometimes. The pool is not within the main hotel area and had to walk out of the hotel and to the nearby beach villas. Slight inconvenience but still acceptable.

I booked 3 rooms for my family of 7. requested for connecting room as we had a baby and it would be more convenient. initially the staff declined our request because my brother in law ic is of different residential address. had to make a fuss before they gave us the connecting room. and I do not understand the 5 pax per room rule? I thought restrictions had been eased and social gathering of 8 person is allowed? anyway, they also require every single person's IC for registration which is understandable however each time we exit and go back to our hotel room, we need to present our IC again. even baby needs to have their birth cert presented. staff were extremely inflexible/unaccommodating. do not recommend visiting this hotel especially if you have a big family."

K.,22-Mar-21,"The staff were awesome honestly. always so friendly and professional. they have made the experience really nice for us if not for the other stuff: I just didn't expect some of the things such as parking was free but for only 1 exit. We booked 3 rooms, 1 for ourselves and 2 for our parents and in laws (they were 70-80yrs old). we drove 2 cars and cos the location was quite a distance to the beach, and our parents couldn't walk a lot, we drove in and out of the car park. all within Sentosa, jus that once you drive out of rws carpark, you have to pay for parking. the lady was nice enough to give us 1 extra ticket. but cos we go in and out a few times, we still had to pay parking. parking in rws wasn't cheap. the other thing was that every time you step out of the room to go to reception or the pool, you have to dig out for your IC when you come back in-for every single person. I understand that it's a requirement. but there's gotta be a way to make it more efficient. I had 6 bags of food in my hands when I'm alone, I had to struggle to take my IC out. if we forgot something in the car not even 5mins after coming into the room entrance, we still had to show our IC. I went for a staycay in other hotels but it wasn't like this. this was to the extent of annoying. there's gotta be a way to fix check this IC only at the entrance of hotel and that's it. breakfast - I didn't know the breakfast was not within Aquarius. we had to take a shuttle bus to go for breakfast. not far but again, if you have elderly with u, it's not very convenient. getting a swimming slot was also quite impossible. on the day of check no slots. our kids were upset cos they really wanted to swim. but you know what.. we decided to try our luck 1.5 hour before we checked out and went ahead for walk-in. the pool was not not crowded. maybe only 10 people in there. we managed to squeeze in only a 30min swim, better than nothing. the pool was beautiful and we could have spent more time there if it wasn't for the booking being full. sure, there's probably some inconsiderate people who booked but did not turn up. perhaps a waiting list would be great. another hotel we stayed in, called us when those who booked did not turn up."

Need to travel to Hotel Michael via shuttle service. Very inconvenient as the time is until 1030am only. This information is not provided in the website/coupon. - Parking is given per night one only unlike other hotels I have stayed before. Hence, upon check in, you cannot travel out unless you don't mind paying the carpark fee tt can be expensive. - No In room dining or restaurant in the hotel itself. The food to order is from Malaysian street which is limited & not everything is halal. Ended up buying via Foodpanda. - Check out time is strictly 11am. No extension given. - Cleaniness is 3/5. The room is still smelly and balcony was dirty. Eg. have brid shit and cigg ashes around. - Do not expect any complimentary snacks/to buy snacks off the bar.

The beds are super comfy, the bath amenities are lovely, the shower works perfectly, everything was clean, definitely, nothing to complain about! I especially love how the hotel did not provide drinking water in plastic bottles. They provided refillable water jugs instead, which we can easily fill with ice/cold water in the nearby ice/water machine at the end of the hall. Getting around was really easy with the free and frequent shuttle buses that took us to nearby hotels and the forum - where we can find plenty of dining and shopping options (including casinos and entrance to the Universal Studio Singapore) The hotel also provided us with complimentary monorail tickets valid for 3 days - so we can easily go back and forth to vivo city mall to do more shopping and find more dining options."
